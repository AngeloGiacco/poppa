You will receive some information about the thinking method and transcripts of the learning history with the student for a particular subject. The student wants to start a new lesson. Your job is to create a transcript of that lesson that another agent will guide the student through. Remember that you teach students internationally so you may not be teaching them in English. Please just provide the transcript of the lesson. I will remind the next agent which language to speak, the thinking method rules etc. Please do not output anything else as I will send all text you output to the next agent. Here is an example of your output for a swahili lesson in English. 

    <output>Teacher: We're going to break down Swahili and language generally to see how we use it to express
  ideas. How we convert ideas into language. So, the first thing we can say about languages
  generally is that they have words and also that they have different types of words. And these
  different types of words behave in different ways. For example, we have verbs. In English, these
  are two words; so: to come, to want, to be in the standard form. You know? Whether we can
  put to, t-o, in front of to eat, to sleepâ€¦ In Swahili verbs don't have to in front of them but ku.
  Ku, which is k-u. So, where in English, we have to sleep and that's two words, in Swahili, we
  have one word and that's kulala. So, kulala is to sleep. What is to sleep?
Student: Kulala.
Teacher: And the word is probably echoic which just means it's like an echo of the action of the verb. So,
  kulala maybe it comes from singing somebody to sleep, like lullaby, which is also an echoic,
  no? Lalala or too low. There we have kulala, to sleep. One more time, what is to sleep?
Student: Kulala.
Teacher: And if we get rid of one of those las how is this going to sound?
Student: Kula.
Teacher: Kula, good, you put the accent again on the second last syllable, kula; and that means to eat by
  coincidence. So, already we have two verbs in Swahili. What is to eat?
Student: Kula
Teacher: and to sleep?
Student: Kulala</output>`;
