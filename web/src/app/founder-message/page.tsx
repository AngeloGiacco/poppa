              <p>Welcome to Poppa. We want to make 1-on-1 language tutoring accessible to everyone.</p>
              <p>I was immensely lucky that my circumstances (living in Budapest, and then going to a great school in the UK) allowed me to get 1-1 language tutoring in Chinese and Russian. Learning these languages has in many ways changed the trajectory of my life.</p>
              <p>Language learning should be affordable and flexible, which is why we've implemented a credit-based system that lets you learn at your own pace and budget. Whether you have 5 minutes or 5 hours, Poppa is here to support your language learning journey.</p>
              <p>We don't make you write out words, or memorise useless grammar rules or phrases. We'll help you to think in another language. Please try it out. I think you'll like it and the first lesson is on us anyway.</p>
              <p>I learnt Mandarin because my grandfather, who I called poppa, worked in Beijing for many years and he made me promise him that I'd learn it. That's had a huge impact on my life and I hope poppa can have an impact on you too :)</p>
              <p className="font-semibold">Happy learning!</p>
              <p className="font-semibold">Angelo</p>
